    <figcaption id="d">Sushi traces its origins back for millennia, to the rice fields of Asia –<br />
        China, to be specific. This may be shocking to you, <br />
        as most people assume that sushi was first created in Japan. However,<br />
        this is not the case. While Japan is certainly the sushi capital of the world – <br />
        and responsible for introducing the dish to travelers – sushi traces its origins back <br />
        to a Chinese dish called narezushi.<br />
        This dish consisted of fermented rice and salted fish. And, <br />
        despite what you may think, it wasn’t fermented and salted for flavor.<br />

<h2>Ingredient</h2>
    
    <ul id="d">
        <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>¼ cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 pieces imitation crab legs</li>
        <li>½ (3 ounce) package cream cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol id="d">
        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.<br />
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, <br />
            and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.<br />
            Stir in rice vinegar and salt. Allow to cool completely.</li><br />

        <li>Lay out seaweed sheets. Moisten hands with water,<br />
            then spread the rice evenly on each sheet, leaving a 1/2 inch gap along one edge,<br />
            lengthwise. Arrange strips of cucumber, imitation crabmeat,<br />
            and cream cheese in a straight line along the side opposite of the gap. <br />
            Roll the sushi from the toppings to the exposed end of the the seaweed sheet.</li><br/>
        
            <li>Using a sharp wet knife, slice each roll into 5 or 6 pieces.<br />
             Serve with minced ginger on the side.</li><br/>
